# Kyle Docs

This repository contains the documentation for a variety of my projects.

I use [GitBook](https://www.gitbook.com) to host the documentation. The documentation is written in
Markdown and is located in the `docs` folder.

## Modifying the Documentation

To create or modify any of the documentation, you simply need to edit the Markdown files in the
`docs` folder. You can use any Markdown editor you like.

### To create a new page:

1. Create a new Markdown file in the `docs` folder.
2. Add the new page to the `SUMMARY.md` file.

### To modify an existing page:

1. Edit the Markdown file in the `docs` folder. _duh_
